          <p>(CNN) Hamas’s surprise October 7 attacks stunned Israel. But not everyone was caught unaware. When he learned the news, Dr. Yuval Bitton says he felt it was coming – and knew immediately who was behind it.</p>
          <p>“I know the person who planned and conceived and initiated this criminal attack,” Bitton told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour. “I have known him since 1996 – not only him but the entire Hamas leadership in Gaza – and it was clear to me that this is what they were planning.”</p>

          <p>Good to know The most recent major version of Python is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular. In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.</p>
          <p>Python Syntax compared to other programming languages Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics. Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses. Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose. For example:</p>
          <ul class="code-list">
            <li><code>print("Hello, World!")</code></li><br>
            <li><code>import sys print(sys.version)</code></li><br>
            <li><code>if 5 > 2: print("Five is greater than two!")</code></li><br>
            <li><code>#This is a comment print("Hello, World!")</code></li><br>
            <li><code>#This is a comment #written in #more than just one line print("Hello, World!")</code></li>
          </ul>

          <p>The head of the International Monetary Fund on Thursday called on Europe to achieve the full potential of its prized single market, lamenting what she described as a situation that makes the region look like “an ideas supermarket” for the U.S.</p>
          <p>Speaking to CNBC’s Karen Tso, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said Europe’s economic performance was strengthening and inflation was clearly on a downward trajectory.</p>

          <p>England wasted the chance to secure their place in the Euro 2024 knockout stages as Group C winners as they were fortunate to take a draw from a dismal display against Denmark in Frankfurt.</p>
          <p>Gareth Southgate’s side would have topped Group C with a win after the earlier draw between Slovenia and Serbia - but were ultimately grateful for a point from a disorganised, shambolic mess of performance.</p>
